I am a Senior Research Engineer on the [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/) team, involved in R&D for natural language processing (NLP). I work on building and evaluating large language models (LLMs). Most recently, I have worked on [FlexOlmo](https://allenai.org/blog/flexolmo) and [Olmo](https://allenai.org/olmo) projects. I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2020, where I worked with Prof. [Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) at the intersection of NLP and digital humanities.

<!-- , where I contributed to

<!-- * [dataset](https://blog.allenai.org/dolma-3-trillion-tokens-open-llm-corpus-9a0ff4b8da64) construction
* [model pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00838)
* evaluation [tools](https://github.com/allenai/ai2-olmo-eval) and [benchmark](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:266348815) -->

<!-- During my Master's at UMass Amherst, I worked with Prof. Mohit Iyyer on interpreting what neural models learn about stylistic content in fictional text, and with Prof. Eric Poehler from UMass Classics department to automate dataset construction and build an interface to explore art and architecture of Pompeii (ancient Roman city). I also collaborated with Scripps Research to improve the quality of crowd-sourced annotations in biomedical text using graphical models, for better named entity recognition.

Previously, I have worked at Cerebellum Capital (Summer 2019), and at [InFoCusp](https://infocusp.in) (2015-2018). -->
